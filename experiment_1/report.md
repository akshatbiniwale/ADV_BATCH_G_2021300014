# About the Dataset!

**Kaggle Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahir1413/global-superstore-2016

The dataset is a Global Superstore dataset based on sales and was found on Kaggle. It offers multiple interesting dimensions to explore like order priority, product category, ship mode, location details, product segment and time series information. Our main KPI's for this Dataset were that of Total Sales, Profit and Quantity.


# My Observations

1. **Sales by Market:** Most of the sales are made in the continents of Asia Pacific and Europe while the least are made in the continent of Africa
2. **Profit by Segment:** Consumer segment accounts for the largest profit while the least profit (which is still a major chunk) is made by Home Office segment
3. **Sum of Sales by Year and Quarter:** Every year the sales dip in the first quarter while make good profits in the remaining quarters, although the overall sales are increasing over the years

The remaining charts only indicate the top or bottom products and customers.
