The Women Empowerment Index (WEI) is a multifaceted tool designed to assess and track the progress of women's empowerment within societies. Drawing from diverse metrics and indicators, the WEI offers a nuanced understanding of the status of women across various domains. It builds upon the foundation laid by existing indices like the Gender Inequality Index (GII) but focuses specifically on aspects related to women's empowerment. The WEI encompasses several key dimensions, including economic participation, political representation, access to education and healthcare, and social inclusivity. By analyzing these dimensions, the index sheds light on the extent to which women are able to exercise agency, access resources, and participate fully in societal processes.


# My Observations

1. **Observation 1:** The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) scores across countries show a roughly normal distribution with most countries falling between 0.45 and 0.75, while there are a few outliers with very low scores around 0.15.
2. **Observation 2:** The world map shows WEI scores represented by varying shades of blue, with darker blues concentrated in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand, while large portions of Asia, Africa, and some South American countries appear in gray, indicating missing data.
3. **Observation 3:** The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) shows a clear positive correlation with Human Development Group (HDG) levels, with median values increasing from around 0.45 in Low HDG to 0.75 in Very High HDG countries.
4. **Observation 4:** The scatter plot shows WEI (Women's Empowerment Index) and GGPI (Global Gender Parity Index) scores for different countries, with values ranging from 0.15 to 0.85 for WEI and 0.15 to 0.95 for GGPI.
5. **Observation 5:** The pie plot reveals that the majority of the dataset falls within the lower levels of women's empowerment, highlighting significant areas needing improvement and underscoring the necessity for targeted initiatives to enhance economic participation, political representation, access to education and healthcare, and social inclusivity for women in these regions.
